# Books I read in 2018

Here's a list of books I read in 2018 in no particular order.  
Ratings are out of 5 stars. 

 - Less (Winner of the Pulitzer Prize): A Novel  
**By Andrew Sean Greer**  
:star: :star: :star: :star:  
<br>

- How to Change Your Mind  
**By Michael Pollan**  
:star: :star: :star:  
_I "read" this one via an audiobook. It was fun to have it narrated by Michael Pollan due to his natural cadence and rhythm in reading._  
<br>

- Call Me by Your Name: A Novel  
**By André Aciman**  
:star: :star: :star: :star:  
_I picked up this book after watching the film. I loved the way this novel was able to capture the deep infatuation of first love._  

    > What struck me was not just his amazing gift for reading people, for rummaging inside them and digging out the precise configuration of their personality, but his ability to intuit things in exactly the way I myself might have intuited them.


<br>

- Sourdough: A novel  
**By Robin Sloan**  
  :star: :star: :star:  
  _Cute and original, and fun to read if you're from San Francisco: plenty of references to local neighborhoods and the pains of working in tech._     
  
    > We are the children of Hogwarts, and more than anything, we just want to be sorted.


<br>

- But What if We're Wrong?: Thinking About the Present As If it Were the Past   
**By Chuck Kosterman**  
  :star: :star:  
  _Klosterman's writing feels very hit or miss: you either love him or you don't. In this book, I didn't._   
  
    > The most amazing writer of this generation is someone you’ve never heard of, representing a subculture we don’t even recognize, expressing ideas that don’t signify what they appear to mean.


<br>

- The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle: A Novel  
**By Haruki Murakami**  
:star: :star: :star: :star: :star:  
    
    > Curiosity can bring guts out of hiding at times, maybe even get them going. But curiosity usually evaporates. Guts have to go for the long haul. Curiosity’s like a fun friend you can’t really trust. It turns you on and then it leaves you to make it on your own—with whatever guts you can muster.  

<br>

- Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis  
**By J.D. Vance**  

    > What separates the successful from the unsuccessful are the expectations that they had for their own lives. Yet the message of the right is increasingly: It’s not your fault that you’re a loser; it’s the government’s fault.

<br>

- Vacationland: True Stories from Painful Beaches  
  **By John Hodgeman**  
  :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:  
  
    > Wine, on the other hand, is like religion: it’s mysterious,     sometimes literally opaque, and there are too many kinds of it. You never really know if a particular wine is good or bad; you just have to take it on faith from some judgy wine priest, an initiate to its mysteries. And wine is also like religion because the people who really get into it tend to be fucking unbearable.

    > day by day i realize <br> 
      everything i miss about you <br>
      was never there in the first place <br> 
      -- the person i fell in love with was a mirage.
