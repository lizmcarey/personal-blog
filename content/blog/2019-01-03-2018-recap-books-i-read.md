- How to Change Your Mind  
**By Michael Pollan**  
:star: :star: :star:  
I "read" this one via an audiobook. It was fun to have it narrated by Michael Pollan due to his natural cadence and rhythm in reading. 

- Call Me by Your Name: A Novel  
**By Andr√© Aciman**  
:star: :star: :star: :star:  
_I picked up this book after watching the film._   

- Sourdough: A novel  
**By Robin Sloan**  
:star: :star: :star:  
Cute and original, and fun to read if you're from San Francisco: plenty of references to local neighborhoods and the pains of working in tech. 

- But What if We're Wrong?: Thinking About the Present As If it Were the Past   
**By Chuck Kosterman** 

- The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle: A Novel  
**By Haruki Murakami**
