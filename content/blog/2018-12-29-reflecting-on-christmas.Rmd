A sign of getting older is when visiting home becomes more stressful, than not. With every year that passes, a responsbility is added and layered to your plate.

Holidays are no longer about about predicting what gifts I'll receive, but rather headcount and logistics planning, including meal prep. 

**2018 Carey family Christmas menu:**  

 * Mixed salad
 * Roasted root vegetables (recipe from [NYT Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016559-roasted-carrots-and-parsnips-with-rosemary-and-garlic?action=click&module=Global%20Search%20Recipe%20Card&pgType=search&rank=2))
 * Mashed potatoes
 * Beef tenderloin with horseradish crème fraîche sauce (recipe from [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/12/slow-roasted-beef-tenderloin-recipe.html)  \)
 * Apple crisp

**Christmas Eve Shopping tips:**  
Grocery shopping on Christmas eve is a depressing event: The shelves are empty, the store clerks don't want to be there, and everyone currently shopping is in a state of panic and distress, desparately hoping to cross off the remaining items on their grocery lists. 

**Notes on the menu items:**  

 * Add quartered red onions to the root vegetables
 * Coring parsnips is nonsense, disregard those instructions
 * Use the [horseradish crème fraîche recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018533-horseradish-creme-fraiche-sauce) from NYT cooking, it's less effort than Serious Eats
 * Horseradish is impossible to find on Christmas Eve, but ginger makes a great substitute! 
 * Use an instant read thermometer to cook the beef to your liking (I went a bought a [Thermapen MK4](https://www.thermoworks.com/Thermapen-Mk4) for next year)
