<p>I finally started a blog!</p>
<p>I first thought about starting a blog 3 years ago. I never went through it because:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I didn’t know where to begin</li>
<li>I couldn’t think of any content</li>
<li>Laziness</li>
</ol>
<p>The trick is to set aside a few hours and <strong>commit.</strong></p>
<p>If you’re familiar with R, the only resource you need is Yihui Xie’s <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown book.</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Here are the steps I took to publish this blog:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Found a blog theme I liked</strong> </br> Browsing through Hugo’s <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io">template collections</a> was overwheleming. Instead, I went through the personal websites of rstats profiles I currently follow (e.g. <a href="https://yihui.name/">Yihue Xie</a>, <a href="http://hadley.nz/">Hadley Wickham</a>, <a href="https://www.andrewheiss.com/">Andrew Heiss</a>, <a href="http://varianceexplained.org/">David Robinson</a>, <a href="https://maraaverick.rbind.io/">Mara Averick</a>). </br>I settled on the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/cocoa-eh-hugo-theme/">Cocoa Enhanced</a> theme on <a href="https://juliasilge.com/">Julia Silge’s website</a>.</li>
</ul>
