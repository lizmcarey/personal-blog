<p>A sign of getting older is when visiting home becomes more stressful, than not. With every year that passes, a responsbility is added and layered to your plate.</p>
<p>Holidays are no longer about about predicting what gifts I’ll receive, but rather headcount and logistics planning, including meal prep.</p>
<p><strong>2018 Carey family Christmas menu:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mixed salad</li>
<li>Roasted root vegetables (recipe from <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016559-roasted-carrots-and-parsnips-with-rosemary-and-garlic?action=click&amp;module=Global%20Search%20Recipe%20Card&amp;pgType=search&amp;rank=2">NYT Cooking</a>)</li>
<li>Mashed potatoes</li>
<li>Beef tenderloin with horseradish crème fraîche sauce (recipe from <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/12/slow-roasted-beef-tenderloin-recipe.html">Serious Eats</a> )</li>
<li>Apple crisp</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Christmas Eve Shopping tips:</strong><br />
Grocery shopping on Christmas eve is a depressing event: The shelves are empty, the store clerks don’t want to be there, and everyone currently shopping is in a state of panic and distress, desparately hoping to cross off the remaining items on their grocery lists.</p>
<p><strong>Notes on the menu items:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add quartered red onions to the root vegetables</li>
<li>Coring parsnips is nonsense, disregard those instructions</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018533-horseradish-creme-fraiche-sauce">horseradish crème fraîche recipe</a> from NYT cooking, it’s less effort than Serious Eats</li>
<li>Horseradish is impossible to find on Christmas Eve, but ginger makes a great substitute!</li>
<li>Use an instant read thermometer to cook the beef to your liking (I went a bought a <a href="https://www.thermoworks.com/Thermapen-Mk4">Thermapen MK4</a> for next year)</li>
</ul>
