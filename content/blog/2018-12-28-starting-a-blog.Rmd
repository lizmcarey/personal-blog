I finally started a blog! 

I first thought about starting a blog 3 years ago. I never went through it because:  

1. I didn't know where to begin
2. I couldn't think of any content
3. Laziness

The trick is to set aside a few hours and **commit.** 

If you're familiar with R, the only resource you need is Yihui Xie's [blogdown book.](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)

Key tips that helped me publish this blog: 

* **Find a blog theme you like from people you follow**  
Browsing through Hugo's [template collections](https://themes.gohugo.io) was overwhelming. Instead, I went through the personal websites of rstats profiles I currently follow (e.g. [Yihue Xie](https://yihui.name/), [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/), [Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com/), [David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/), [Mara Averick](https://maraaverick.rbind.io/)). I settled on the [Cocoa Enhanced](https://themes.gohugo.io/cocoa-eh-hugo-theme/) theme on [Julia Silge's website](https://juliasilge.com/). 

* **Init Git and deploy through Netlify**  
Take the time to create a repo on Github and link your local files. Being able to push changes through Git and have it continuously deployed through Netlify is a huge time saver.  If Netlify isn't automatically deploying changes from your repo, be sure you created an environment variable `HUGO_VERSION` with a version greater than or equal to 0.20. You can read more [here.](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/netlify.html)

* **Use the Serve Site add-in**  
The Serve Site add-in lets you preview edits you've made in the Viewer pane in Rstudio. I found this super helpful in helping guide any major changes to my blog. 

You can find a well documented post on how to publish your own website using blogdown on [Alison Hill's website.](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/)
